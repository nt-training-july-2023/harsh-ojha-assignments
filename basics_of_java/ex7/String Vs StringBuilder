String and StringBuilder both holds the series of characters.

The main difference between them is Strings are immutable and StingBuilder are mutable'
That is, once initialized we can not modify a string object, if we do so then a new 
String object will be created in the String pool and the reference will be changed
to the new object.

But in case of String Builder, as string builders mutable, we can modify the string in the
string builder in the same object. Hence it is more efficient and an mutable alternative
of the String. 

StringBuilder class is preferred over String when we have to perform modification of 
the String multiple times. Then it makes the code more efficient.

The StringBuilder are not stored in String Pool, they are stored in the heap memory
of the objects.
