Following are the features of Java--

1.Simple:-
	Java syntax is easy to learn and is based on C++, hence it is easy to code.
	Java does not have the pointer concept as it is complicated.
	
2.Secure:-
	Java does not have the pointer concept , all the variables and memory of the
	objects is managed by Java. Hence it is really difficult for anyone to exploit the 
	security of Java.
	Java also follows concept of OOPS(Encapsulation and Abstraction) which makes the 
	code more secure.

3.Portable:-
	Java code is portable. It is platform independent i.e,
	write once run anywhere. We can write the java code in the windows 
	and run it in the linux , all we need is the JVM. Java virtual machine.
	
4.Strong:-
	Java has many features which make Java a strong programming language.
	like- Garbage collection, no pointers.
	
5.Architecture- neutral:-
	This defines that features of Java independent of their implementation.
	i.e, we have to predefine the data-type of the variable, so it also defines what
	are the methods and implementations the variable can follow and access.
	
6.High Performance:-
	Java is a fast language. It is faster than interpreted languages like python ,
	but slower than compiled languages like c++ and c. Java is combination of
	compiled and interpreted language as the java code is compiled first and then the
	byte-code is interpreted line by line and executed by converting it into 
	machine level code.
	
7.Distributed:-
	Java is distributed, as it is used in many technologies. and also can be accessed from
	the cloud or internet directly. 
	
8.Dynamic:-
	Java is a dynamic language, as the classes are loaded dynamically on demand and
	the Garbage collector also works dynamically when the code is run,
	i.e., runtime.
